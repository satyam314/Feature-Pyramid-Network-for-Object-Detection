# Feature-Pyramid-Network-for-Object-Detection
This project aims to detect objects within an image also providing the confidence interval with which the object is detected. We have used Feature Pyramid Network over ResNet50 and Faster RCNN architecture to do the same. We have also designed an API using flask for testing new inputs on the trained model.
